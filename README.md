# ToastCalc
A webapp for Toastmasters which allows you to check your progress.

You can input your current status on the CC and CL manuals and when you hope to finish them by and it will give a reccomendation on how often you will have to complete a speech/task to reach your goal. It also tells you when you will finish your manuals if you keep on going at your current rate.

This is an open-source project which will soon be available for iOS and Android on the app and play stores

Keep on Toasting everybody!
