		<h1>About me!</h1>

		<p>
			My name is Aazir Munir, a member of <a href="http://2432.toastmastersclubs.org/">KW toastmasters</a> in District 86. I created ToastCalculator so that toastmasters everywhere could easily track their progress through the Competent Communicator and Competent Leader manuals.

			<p></p>

			Using this platform you can see what your rate of completion has been, set a goal date, and find out how fast youâ€™ll have to move to reach that goal.

			<p></p>
			This project is completely open-source, and you can contribute or send bug reports or feature requests at the <a href="https://github.com/a22munir/ToastCalc"> Github repository  </a>.
			<p></p>

			I am a freelance web developer and am currently looking for clients/full time work. You can view my <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/aazirmunir">resume</a> and my<a href="http://aazirmunir.com/port/"> portfolio </a>. Thanks for visiting and keep on toasting!
